                        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                            <br /></p>
                        <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.&nbsp; Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br /></p>
                        <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
                        <p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.<br /></p>
                        <p>Stay informed:<br /></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>fever</li>

                        <p>People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.</p>
                        <p>People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.

                            <li>Avoid touching your face.<br /></li>
                            <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.<br /></li>
                            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.<br /></li>
                            <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.<br /></li>
